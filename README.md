# Project-_Decoder_ring-Shaun_McRae-Solution
Encryption/decryption app

## Instructions
Install dependencies locally by running the command:
npm i

To run the tests, you can run the following command:
npm test

To use the code, you can run the following command. This command will start a server and take over your terminal window. To stop the server from running, you can press Control+C.
npm start

## Purpose
A decoder app that allows you to encode and decode messgaes using various algorithms by running a local server.

## Description and Features
Able to decode and encode 3 types of algorithms: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution Cipher. Each algorithm has a description and a text box to input the message.

## Improvements and Future
- Add additional algorithms.
- To help navigation with additoinal algorithms, inlude a dropdown menu, cards, or sidebar for easy navigation.
- Create randomly generated messages using a random cipher so that users can practice cracking the code.
